# Birkbeck Piazza -  Cloud Computing Concepts Coursework

## 1. Development of a Cloud Software as a Service

The coursework aims to make you apply the concepts and software development methods and
frameworks seen in class to develop a Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS).

- You will need to install, develop, test and deploy a Cloud SaaS in virtualised environments,
such as VMs and containers, as per the guidelines described in this document.
- Upload your final scripts and a technical report to describe the functionality of your solution
following the guidelines of the coursework brief document.

## 2. The Piazza system

You must develop a RESTful SaaS for a Twitter-like system called **Piazza**. In **Piazza** , users post
messages for a particular topic while others browse posts, e.g., per topic and perform fundamental
interactions, including liking, disliking, or adding a comment. You should install, test, and document
your developments as described in Section 3.

**Piazza** should support the following actions.

| Action       | Description                                                                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action 1     | Authorised users access the Piazza API using the oAuth v2 protocol to perform any interaction.               |
| Action 2     | Authorised users post a message for a particular topic in the Piazza API.                                    |
| Action 3     | Registered users browse messages per topic using the Piazza API.                                             |
| Action 4     | Registered users perform basic operations, including “like”, “dislike”, or “comment” a message posted for a topic. |
| Action 5     | Authorised users could browse for the most active post per topic with the highest likes and dislikes.        |
| Action 6     | Authorised users could browse the history data of expired posts per topic.                                   |

You recommended using the Node.js Express package and MongoDB to develop your software. If you
like, you can use any other programming framework or database you prefer. You are advised to use code
samples from the lab tutorials and online sources by providing the appropriate references (in text and
code). In the technical report, you can improvise by describing your functionality and implementation
decisions and include a diagram to demonstrate your implementation.

## 3. Coursework phases

**Phase A: Install and deploy software in virtualised environments [ 10 marks]**

- Install all the necessary packages in your virtual machine.
- Deploy your code in the virtual machine using your GitHub repository.
- Your REST API endpoints should be available under your virtual machine IP address based on
    examples and guidelines seen in class.
- Provide a short description of your setup in the report.
- Briefly discuss your installation and the structure of your folders.
    ̈ Provide screenshots if necessary.
- Do not include Linux commands in the report.

**Phase B: Enforcing authentication/verification functionalities [5 marks]**

- Your service should include user management and JWT functionality using NodeJS.
    ̈ The JWT will authorise the auctioning RESTful API to store data for authorised users
       in your database.
    ̈ You can use a MongoDB database for storing data required in the coursework, as shown
       in the labs.
- Your code should authenticate users each time you perform any action point of the following
    Part C, for example, whenever users post, interact, or browse messages.
       ̈ Unauthorised users are not allowed to access your resources and perform database
          requests.
- Any user input should follow a verification process for validation purposes. You are encouraged
    to improvise and apply your validations.

**Phase C: Development of Piazza RESTful APIs [ 30 marks]**

- Your APIs should allow the basic functionalities provided in the Action points of Section 2.
- Each post on the **Piazza** wall should include the following data:
       ̈* The post identifier.
       ̈* The title of a post.
       * The topic of a post from one of the following four categories: Politics, Health, Sport or Tech. Each post could belong to one or more topics.
       * A timestamp of the post-registration in the **Piazza** API.
       * The message body of a post.
       * The post-expiration time. After the end of this time, the message will remain on the Piazza wall, but it will not accept any further actions, e.g. (likes, dislikes, or comments).
       *  The status of a post could be “Live” or “Expired”.
       * Information about the post owner (e.g., a name).
       * The number of likes, dislikes, or a list of comments, if any.
       * Any other information you might need to store essential for your project.
- Each user interaction with a post on a topic (like, dislike or comment) should include the following data:
       ̈* Information about the user interacting with the post of a topic (e.g., a name).
       ̈* The interaction value (including a like, a dislike, or a comment made).
       ̈* The time left for a post to expire.
       ̈* Any other information you can store essential for your project.
- You are encouraged to develop your database collections and application logic and expand Phase C as required.
       ̈* Provide a brief description of your database models in the report.
       ̈* Use screenshots if necessary.
- You should list the RESTful API endpoints in your report with a simple example of using your API.
- Consider the following.
    ̈*  Only authorised users should access the API.
    ̈* The API should allow any registered user to perform posts.
    ̈* You are encouraged to set any other constraints to improve the software's functionality.
    ̈* You are encouraged to improvise and develop any functionality you like.

**Phase D: Testing your application [15 marks]**

You can demonstrate the testing aspects of your software using Postman, e.g., by including screenshots
in the report or by developing a sting application. For example, you can develop a testing application
using Node.js or Python to automate the test cases of users posting messages. This application should
be developed outside your virtual machine, e.g., on your desktop or laptop. The testing application
should connect to the API endpoints and perform the required HTTP calls to manipulate data. The test
cases should demonstrate Action points, as described in Section 2. The test cases will verify your system
functionality.

Let us assume a use case scenario of four users, Olga, Nick, Mary, and Nestor, accessing the Piazza
API. Provide the following test cases (TCs).

**TC 1.** Olga, Nick, Mary, and Nestor register and are ready to access the **Piazza** API.
**TC 2.** Olga, Nick, Mary, and Nestor use the oAuth v2 authorisation service to register and get
their tokens.
**TC 3.** Olga makes a call to the API without using her token. This call should be unsuccessful as
the user is unauthorised.
**TC 4.** Olga posts a message in the Tech topic with an expiration time (e.g. 5 minutes) using her
token. After the end of the expiration time, the message will not accept any further user
interactions (likes, dislikes, or comments).
**TC 5.** Nick posts a message in the Tech topic with an expiration time using his token.
**TC 6.** Mary posts a message in the Tech topic with an expiration time using her token.
**TC 7.** Nick and Olga browse all the available posts in the Tech topic; three posts should be
available with zero likes, zero dislikes and no comments.
**TC 8.** Nick and Olga “like” Mary’s post on the Tech topic.
**TC 9.** Nestor “likes” Nick’s post and “dislikes” Mary’s on the Tech topic.
**TC 10.** Nick browses all the available posts on the Tech topic; at this stage, he can see the number
of likes and dislikes for each post (Mary has two likes and one dislike, and Nick has one
like). There are no comments made yet.
**TC 11.** Mary likes her post on the Tech topic. This call should be unsuccessful; in **Piazza,** a post
owner cannot like their messages.
**TC 12.** Nick and Olga comment on Mary’s post on the Tech topic in a round-robin fashion (one
after the other, adding at least two comments each).
**TC 13.** Nick browses all the available posts in the Tech topic; at this stage, he can see the number
of likes and dislikes of each post and the comments made.
**TC 14.** Nestor posts a message in the Health topic with an expiration time using her token.
**TC 15.** Mary browses all the available posts on the Health topic; at this stage, she can see only
Nestor’s post.
**TC 16.** Mary posts a comment in Nestor’s message on the Health topic.
**TC 17.** Mary dislikes Nestor’s message on the Health topic after the end of post-expiration time.
This should fail.
**TC 18.** Nestor browses all the messages on the Health topic. There should be only one post (his
own) with one comment (Mary’s).
**TC 19.** Nick browses all the expired messages on the Sports topic. These should be empty.
**TC 20.** Nestor queries for an active post with the highest interest (maximum number of likes and
dislikes) in the Tech topic. This should be Mary’s post.

Feel free to develop more test cases to test your implementations. You should provide screenshots or
descriptions of each test case in the report.

**Phase E: Deploy your Piazza project into a VM using Docker [10 marks]**

Upload your code to a GitHub repo and then deploy it in a Google Cloud VM. Provide a list of
commands in the report and screenshots to demonstrate your deployment actions. As an alternative, you
can use DockerHub.

**Phase F: Report your solution in a technical report [ 20 marks]**

Provide details on your implementations, database design, service descriptions, API resources, and any
other information required. You do not need to include a list of the Linux commands in the report.
Provide references to online resources, including source codes from online tutorials or repositories.
There is no report size, but you should keep the report short and solid regarding the development
phases.

**Phase G: Submit quality scripts [ 10 marks]**

Your codes should be written in such a way that makes them highly readable and easy to follow. Good
use of REST concepts, understanding of computational complexity in software development, use of
comments in code, proper database models, proper indentation, clear notations, and simplicity in the
flow are factors to consider.

**Phase H: Go beyond the coursework requirements [0 marks]**

Feel free to create your application name, and don’t forget to design your logo! Improvise and expand
the Piazza functionalities. Using CI/CD pipelines with Terraform to deploy or develop a front-end could
highlight some of these areas.
